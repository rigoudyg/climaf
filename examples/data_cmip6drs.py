Example for CliMAF access to data organized according to CMIP6 DRS such as :
/cnrm/cmip6/CMIP/CNRM-CERFACS/CNRM-CM6-1/historical/r1i1p1f2/Amon/clivi/gr/latest/clivi_Amon_CNRM-CM6-1_historical_r1i1p1f2_gr_185001-201412.nc

This example should work as is at CNRM and IPSL, and can be easily tuned to 
other local CMIP6 datasets

NOTE : Both the CMIP5 project definition and the CMIP5 data locations 
indicated here are actually already declared in standard CliMAF API 
setup (by ``import site_settings`` and ``import standard_projects``)
