## CliMAF : a Climate Model Assessment Framework

CliMAF doc is available at [Readthedocs]
(http://climaf.readthedocs.org/) , which includes [installation instructions](http://climaf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html)

The aim of CliMAF is to allow for an actual, **easy, collaborative development of climate model outputs assessment suites by climate scientists with varied IT background**, and to ultimately share such suites for the benefit of the Climate Science. 

It is basically a python-scriptable way to process NetCDF [CF compliant](http://cfconventions.org/) climate model outputs by piping arbitrary executables, with easy access to datasets and automated results caching.

CliMAF was designed by Stéphane Sénési, who also developped most of the code before version 2.
