CliMAF - a Climate Model Assessment Framework
========================================================


CliMAF is an `Open Source software
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software>`_, distributed
with a GPL-compatible licence. See :doc:`the licence notice
<license>`. 
It is available at  `CliMAF GitHub repository <https://github.com/senesis/climaf>`_

The aim of CliMAF is to allow for an actual, **easy, collaborative development of climate model outputs assessment suites by climate scientists with varied IT background**, and to ultimately share such suites for the benefit of the Climate Science. 


So, CliMAF can be described as :

- an aid for handling access to common climate
  simulations and re-analysis datafiles, and to personnal data
  files, in a uniform way
- a wrapper which provides you with uniform, handy, combination and caching
  features around :

  - **your own** post-processing and analysis **scripts and programs**
  - other tools sets such as `NCO <http://nco.sourceforge.net/>`_ and `CDO <https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo/embedded/1.6.4/cdo.html>`_  operators

- a way to share advanced climate diagnostic modules 
- an actual repository for such modules
- and a visualisation engine for the corresponding results


Description 
----------------

CliMAF is basically a Python-scriptable way to process NetCDF `CF compliant <http://cfconventions.org/>`_ climate model outputs which allows:

- to almost *forget about accessing input data* : you refer to
  'variables' in 'simulations', CliMAF knows a bunch of data
  organization schemes, you just quote some root locations, usually in
  configuration files ; [ under development : data can also be on the
  `ESGF <http://esgf.llnl.gov/>`_ ] 
- **to apply diagnostics (i.e. any post-processing module) coded in
  any langage**, provided they meet very minimal requirements, such as
  described in section :ref:`operators` ;  they can be :

  - either binaries, which accepts command-line arguments, read NetCDF
    files, and output NetCDF files or graphics (yet only in PNG format)
  - or Python function which accept Masked Arrays data structure as inputs and outputs

- to easily **pipe and combine such diagnostic** binaries or functions
- to describe the piping using Python scripting, thus building formal
  expressions in a simple syntax (called **CRS** for CliMAF Reference Syntax) 
- to trigger CRS expression computation only once needed
- to handle a cache of results, which access keys are CRS expressions

A very low-profile knowledge of Python is enough to take full advantage of CliMAF
