Changes, newest first :

.. _news_0.9:

- 2015/07/31 - Version 0.9 :

 - Operator 'lines' is smarter re.time axis: (see
   :doc:`scripts/lines`)

   - Tick marks are smartly adapted to the time period duration. 
   - When datasets does not cover the same time period, the user can
     choose wether time axis will be aligned to the same origin or
     just be the union of all time periods 

.. _news_0.7:

- 2015/05/20 - Version 0.7 :

 - Handle **explicitly defined objects ensembles** (see
   :py:class:`~climaf.classes.cens`) and **explicit dataset ensembles**
   (see :py:func:`~climaf.classes.eds`. Operators which are not
   ensemble-capable will be automagically looped over members. See  
   examples in :download:`ensemble.py <../examples/ensemble.py>`.
 - New standard operator ``lines`` for **plotting profiles or other xy 
   curves for ensembles**; see :doc:`scripts/lines`
 - Standard operator ``plot`` has new arguments : ``contours`` for
   adding contour lines, ``domain`` for greying out land or ocean; see :doc:`scripts/plot`
 - **Extended access to observation data** as managed by VDR at CNRM :
   GPCC, GPCP, ERAI, ERAI-LAND, CRUTS3, CERES (in addition to
   OBS4MIPS, and CAMI); see :ref:`known_datasets` and examples in 
   :download:`data_obs.py <../examples/data_obs.py>`.
 - Special keyword ``crs`` is replaced by keyword ``title`` : the
   value of CRS expression for an object is provided to script-based
   operators under keyword ``title``, if no title value is provided
   when invoking the operator. Scripts can also independanlty use
   keyword ``crs`` for getting the CRS value
 - cpage keywords changed : widths_list -> widths, heights_list -> heights

.. _news_0.6:

- 2015/05/11 - Version 0.6.1 :

 - Add a **macro** feature : easy definition of a macro from a
   compound object; you can save, edit, load... and macros are used for
   interpreting cache content. See :py:func:`~climaf.cmacros.cmacro`
   and an example in :download:`macro <../examples/macro.py>`.
 - A **general purpose plot operator**, named ``plot``, is fine for
   plotting 1D and 2D datasets (maps, cross-sections, profiles, but
   not Hoevmoeller...) and replaces plotxesc and plotmap. It allows
   for setting explicit levels in palette, stereopolar projection,
   vertical coordinate ... See :doc:`scripts/plot`
 - Can **list or erase cache content using various filters** (on
   age, size, modif date ...); disk usage can be displayed. 
   See :py:func:`~climaf.cache.clist()`, :py:func:`~climaf.cache.cls`, :py:func:`~climaf.cache.crm`,
   :py:func:`~climaf.cache.cdu`, :py:func:`~climaf.cache.cwc`
 - Can create an **array of figures** using
   :py:func:`~climaf.classes.cpage`. See example :download:`figarray <../examples/figarray.py>`.
 - Can **cope with un-declared missing values in data files**, as
   e.g. Gelato outputs with value=1.e+20 over land, which is not the
   declared missing value ; See :py:func:`~climaf.classes.calias()`
   and :py:mod:`~climaf.projects.em`
 - When declaring data re-scaling, can declare units of the result (see 
   :py:func:`~climaf.classes.calias`) 
 - Can declare correspondance between **project-specific frequency names** 
   and normalized names (see :py:func:`~climaf.classes.cfreqs`).
 - Add : howto :ref:`record`
 - Cache content index is saved on exit
 - Add an example of **seaice data handling and plotting**. See :download:`seaice.py <../examples/seaice.py>`

- 2015/04/22 - Version 0.6.0 :

 - Add operator ``plotxsec`` (removed in 0.6.1, see
   replacement at :doc:`scripts/plot` )
 - **A number of 'projects' are built-in**, which describe data
   organization and data location for a number of analyses and
   experiments datasets available at one of our data centers, 
   as e.g. CMIP5, OBS4MIPS, OCMPI5, EM, ...) ; see :ref:`known_datasets` 
 - **Variable alias** and **variable scaling** are now managed, on a
   per-project basis. 
   See function :py:func:`~climaf.classes.calias()`
 - Derived variables can now be defined on a per-project basis. See function :py:func:`~climaf.operators.derive()`
 - CliMAF was proved to **work under a CDAT** install which uses
   Python 2.6
 - Better explain how to install CliMAf (or not), to run it or to use
   it as a library; see :ref:`installing` and :ref:`library`

.. _news_0.5:

- 2015/04/14 - Version 0.5.0 :

 - A versionning scheme is now used, which is based on recommendations found at http://semver.org. 

 - Starting CliMAF :

  - Binary ``climaf`` allows to launch Python and import Climaf at
    once. See :ref:`running_inter`
  - File ``~/.climaf`` is read as configuration file , at the end of
    climaf.api import

 - Input data :

  - New projects can be defined, with project-specific
    facets/attributes. See :py:class:`~climaf.classes.cproject`
  - A number of projects are 'standard' : CMIP5, OCMPIP5, OBS4MIPS,
    EM, CAMIOBS, and example
  - Data location is automatically declared for
    CMIP5 data at CNRM and on Ciclad (in module site_settings)
  - Discard pre-defined organizations 'OCMPI5_Ciclad', 'example', etc,
    and replace it by smart use of organization 'generic'.  Note : **this
    leads to some upward incompatibility** regarding how data
    locations are declared for these datasets; please refer to the
    examples in :download:`data_generic.py
    <../examples/data_generic.py>`).
  - Access to fixed fields is now possible, and fixed fields may be
    specific to a given experiment. . See examples in
    :download:`data_generic.py <../examples/data_generic.py>`  
    and :download:`data_cmip5drs.py <../examples/data_cmip5drs.py>`        
    
 - Operators : 

  - Explanation is available on how to know how a given operator is declared to CliMAF,
    i.e. what is the calling sequence for the external script or binary; see 
    :ref:`how_to_list_operators`
  - Simplify declaration of scripts with no output (just omit ${out})
  - plotmap : this operator now zoom on the data domain, and plot data across
    Greenwich meridian correctly

 - Running CliMAF - messages, cache, errors :

  - Verbosity, and cache directory, can be set using environment
    variables. See :ref:`configuring`
  - Simplify use of function :py:func:`~climaf.clogging.clog`
  - Log messages are indented to show recursive calls of ceval()
  - Quite extended use of Python exceptions for error handling

- 2015/04/06 : 

  - time period in CRS and as an argument to 'ds' is shortened unambiguously and may show only one date
  - function cfile has new arguments : target and link
  - CMIP5 facets 'realm' and 'table' are handled by 'ds', 'dataloc' and 'cdef'
  - organization called 'generic' allow to describe any data file hierarchy and naming
  - organization called 'EM' introduced, and allows to handle CNRM-CM outputs as managed by EM
  - default option for operator regrid is now 'remapbil' rather than 'remapcon2'
  - log messages are tabulated
  - a log file is added, with own severity level, set by clog_file
  - operators with format=None are also evaluated as soon as applied - i.e. cshow no more needednon ncview(...)
